# Example library 4.3: Demonstrating the use of more than one page preconditions in a rule, before applying the rule's css selectors (scraping data) and 
#                      how these preconditions are evaluated. This example demonstrates evaluation using the EVAL operator between
#                      preconditions i.e. a boolean expression can be specified (with all supported logical operators like AND, OR, NOT as well as parentheses) using
#                      as operands the truth value of each of the preconditions. If the boolean expression evaluates to True, the rule is applied. If not
#                      the rule is not applied. EVAL operator requires page preconditions to have names in order to be referenced in EVAL expressions.
# 
# Related fields: rulePreconditionType (EVAL), rulePreconditionExpression, rulePreconditions, ecName
#
#
# This library scraps/extracts the title of english wikipedia articles that are about physicists (i.e. their name) 
# that meet all following requirements:
#  1) are physicists, 2) are born in either january or march or may or october and 3)  have an american nationality.
#
# While the rules in example5.1-en.wikipedic.exr do the same, the rules defined there have the following
# issues:
#   1) they do not make sure that the value checked refers to birthmonth 
#   2) they do not make sure that the value checked refers to nationality
#
# In contrast to the rules in the file example4.2-en.wikipedia.exr, this rule set does not assume 
# that the data is always in very specific positions. This set of rules makes the assumption that
# the data to check can be found in different parts of the infobox. For example, this set
# of rules does not assume that nationality is found in the 5th row. Some pages may have
# this information in a different row. This set of rules attempts to address this by 
# using a boolean expression down to evaluate the preconditions. The boolean expression
# has as operands the result of the evaluation of preconditions (referenced by their name) and
# can use any valid logical operator. The boolean expression that this rule evaluates takes
# the form
#
# precondition1 AND preconditio2 AND ( (predondition3 AND precondition4) OR (predondition5 AND precondition6) OR (predondition7 AND precondition8) ...)
#
# where:
#    * precondition1: the precondition that checks if the page talks about a physicist
#    * precondition2 :the precondition that checks if physicist was born on january or march
#    or may or october
#    * (precondition3 AND precondition4): an expression that checks if the fifth line is
#    about the nationality (precondition3) and has value united states or american (precondition4)
#    * (precondition5 AND precondition6): an expression that checks if the sixth line is
#    about the nationality (precondition3) and has value united states or american (precondition4)
#    etc...
#
# i.e. each expression (preconditionX AND precondition(x+1)) checks if a line is about nationality
# its value is united states or american. Each such conjunction checks a different line in the
# infobox. This boolean expression tests 3 lines but more can be added.
#
#
#
# 
# How to apply this rule:
#
# crawl -M -n -1 -r rules/example4.3-en.wikipedia.exr -o csv/example4.3.csv https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_physicists
#
# NOTE: option -n -1 means no maximum number of pages constraint so that at least some premier league football pages will be fetched/processed. If no -n
# option is provided, maximum number of pages to fetch defaults to setting maxPages in the loaded config file.

# How should the downloaded html page be rendered.
# WebScraper supports two modes of URL downloads:
# static: meaning that the web page does not load its content dynamically (via js or ajax) and one http request is enough to get
#         the entire page content. 
# dynamic: meaning the athe web page has dynamic content that is loaded via js or ajax once the web page has
#          been downloaded or is scrolled. Example of such dynamic pages are e.g. youtube pages where comments are only displayed
#          when the user scrolls down. Scraping such dynamic pages is also supported by WebScraper. Dynamic pages load slower though.
# 
# If renderPages has a value of False, this means the no page rendering is carried out and should be used only in case of pages that
# do not load content dynamicaly.
# If renderPages has a value of True, this means the page rendering is done and should be used only in case of pages that load content
# dynamically. 
# 
# Since we access wikipedia articles with no dynamic content, we will statically load these pages. Hence renderPages is set to False. This
# will make page loading faster. If renderPages is missing, it defaults to False.
