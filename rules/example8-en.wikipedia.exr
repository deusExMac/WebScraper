# Example library 10: Demonstrating the use of a rendering engine to download a page using the renderPages field.
#                     This has the implication of using a rendering engine used by web browsers to download and load the html page. 
#                    
# 
# Related fields: renderPages 
#
#
# This example has the same rules as example 2 extracting the title of wikipedia articles as well as the 
# hyperlinks landing on wikipedia pages. The only difference is that this library used a web rendeting engine 
# that is activated by setting renderPages to true in contrast to example2 that uses simple http requests.
#
# WebScraper has two ways/engines to download pages: The static one, where simple http requests are issued (activated
# when renderPages is set to False) and dynamic one, where a browser rendering engine is used (activated when
# renderPages is set to True)
#
# When to set renderPages to true and use a browser rendering engine:
#      1) When the page loads its html content dynamically, when user interacts with the page e.g. by 
#         scrolling down to load the page's content (see e.g. youtube comments).
#      2) When the page requires some form of interaction in term of button or element clicks by the user
#      3) When individual elements (besides the entire page) needs to be scrolled in order to load their content.
#
#
# In this example wikipedia pages are downloaded using a rendering engine. Note: When setting renderPages to True, 
# this always results in slower page download and processing.
#  
# How to use this rule:
#
# crawl -n 1 -r rules/example10-en.wikipedia.exr -o csv/example10.csv  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)

# How should the downloaded html page be rendered.
# WebScraper supports two modes of URL downloads:
# static: meaning that the web page does not load its content dynamically (via js or ajax) and one http request is enough to get
#         the entire page content. 
# dynamic: meaning the athe web page has dynamic content that is loaded via js or ajax once the web page has
#          been downloaded or is scrolled. Example of such dynamic pages are e.g. youtube pages where comments are only displayed
#          when the user scrolls down. Scraping such dynamic pages is also supported by WebScraper. Dynamic pages load slower though.
# 
# If renderPages has a value of False, this means the no page rendering is carried out and should be used only in case of pages that
# do not load content dynamicaly.
# If renderPages has a value of True, this means the page rendering is done and should be used only in case of pages that load content
# dynamically.

# Rule for extracting links from the page
# A the name getLinks is a keyword signifying a rule that extracts
# hyperlinks found on the page what match the specified conditions.
#
# When you would like to extract and follow hyperlinks found on a webpage,
# you must name the respective rule extracting these hyperlins getLinks.

# extracted data (e.g. they must be added to the queue).
