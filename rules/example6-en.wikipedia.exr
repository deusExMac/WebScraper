# Example library 5: Demonstrating the use of more than one page preconditions with overwriting the specified 
#                    ruleCSSSelector selector. 
#                    i.e. the css selector for scrapping data specified in ruleCSSSelector changes based on which page
#                    precondition is true. ruleCSSSelector overwriting works ONLY when  rulePreconditionType is ANY. If more
#                    than one preconditions are True, the 
#                    changes based on which page precondition holds. 
#                    how these preconditions are evaluated. This example demonstrates evaluation using the ANY operator between
#                    preconditions i.e. rule is applied if any of the specified preconditions is TRUE. 
# 
# This library scraps/extracts the team and coaches' (manager or Head coaches') name of english wikipedia about premier league teams. 
# The rules in
# file example6-en.wikipedia.exr makes the assumption that the managers name is always at a very specific position on the page. However
# this might not always be the case. See e.g.
# 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C. where the coach is recorded with field name "manager" inside the infobox
# and
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C. where the coach is recorded with field name "Head coach" inside the infobox and at
# a different position.
#
# This library demonstrates the use of more than one page preconditions and how these are evaluated to determine if the rule should
# be applied or not. If the evaluation of preconditions return the value TRUE, ruleCSSSelector is applied on the page currently 
# processed.
# If evaluation of preconditions returns FALSE, the rule is not applied.
#
# The library contains rule "getLinks" for harvesting links.
# 
# How to apply this rule:
#
# crawl -M -n -1 -r rules/example5-en.wikipedia.exr -o csv/STATSORALG.csv -G https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics
#
# NOTE: option -n -1 means no maximum number of pages constraint so that at least some premier league football pages will be fetched/processed. If no -n
# option is provided, maximum number of pages to fetch defaults to setting maxPages in the loaded config file.

# Description of the library

"libraryDescription": "Library to extract the title of english wikipedia articles related to statistics OR algebra.",



# List of rule names, whose extracted data should be stored in the csv file. 
# IMPORTANT: date the url was accessed (dateaccessed) and the url are always automatically added to the csv file

"csvLineFormat":["articleTitle"],



# How should the downloaded html page be rendered.
# WebScraper supports two modes of URL downloads:
# static: meaning that the web page does not load its content dynamically (via js or ajax) and one http request is enough to get
#         the entire page content. 
# dynamic: meaning the athe web page has dynamic content that is loaded via js or ajax once the web page has
#          been downloaded or is scrolled. Example of such dynamic pages are e.g. youtube pages where comments are only displayed
#          when the user scrolls down. Scraping such dynamic pages is also supported by WebScraper. Dynamic pages load slower though.
# 
# If renderPages has a value of False, this means the no page rendering is carried out and should be used only in case of pages that
# do not load content dynamicaly.
# If renderPages has a value of True, this means the page rendering is done and should be used only in case of pages that load content
# dynamically. 
# 
# Since we access wikipedia articles with no dynamic content, we will statically load these pages. Hence renderPages is set to False. This
# will make page loading faster. If renderPages is missing, it defaults to False.

"renderPages":False,



# List of individual rules comprising this library and that will be applied to each page downloaded follows. 
# This library consists of one rule only, named articleTitle. The value extracted by this rule
# will be assigned to a special key/variable with the same name as the rule i.e. articleTitle.
# These keys/variables can be references inside thi rule file e.g. see csvLineFormat field above.
