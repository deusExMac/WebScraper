# Example library 10: Demonstrating the use of a rendering engine to download a page using the renderPages field.
#                     This results in using a rendering engine used by web browsers to download and load the html page. 
#                    
# 
# Related fields: renderPages 
#
# This example extracts the article of wikipedia articles using a browser rendering engine. WebScraper has two ways
# to download pages via the WWW: 1) using simple http requests 2) using a browser rendering engine.
# A browser rendering engine is used to download, load and process pages when the field renderPages in .exr is set to True.
# If renderPages is set to False, a simple http request is used. Using a browser rendering engine to download
# pages allows WebScraper a greater range of functionalities such as interacting with the downloaded page.
#
# When to use the browser rendering engine (or When to set renderPages to true):
#      1) When the page loads its html content dynamically, when user interacts with the page e.g. by 
#         scrolling down to load the page's content (see e.g. youtube comments).
#      2) When the page requires some form of interaction in term of button or element clicks by the user
#      3) When individual elements (besides the entire page) needs to be scrolled in order to load their content.
# 
#  Using a browser rendering engine results in a slower downloading and processing of web pages and hence extraction
#  process.
# 
# How to apply this rule:
#
# v0.05a){1}WebScraper >> crawl  -r rules/example10-en.wikipedia.exr -o csv/example10.csv https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)
#
# This will extract the title from the wikipedia page  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) only, 
# save it in the specified csv file and terminate using a browser rendering engine.

# Description of the library

"libraryDescription": "Library to extract the title from one wikipedia article ignoring links",



# List of rule names, whose results should be stored in the csv file. Here only articleTitle is
# mentioned meaning that only the result of the rule named articleTitle should be stored in the csv file.
# If a rule name is NOT included in this list, the data extracted by that rule is NOT stored in the csv file.
# IMPORTANT: date the url was accessed (dateaccessed) and the url are always automatically added to the csv file

"csvLineFormat":["articleTitle"],



# How should the downloaded html page be downloaded? Here, activation of a browser page rendering 
# engine is activated.
# WebScraper supports two modes of URL downloads:
# static: meaning that the web page does not load its content dynamically (via js or ajax) and one http request is enough to get
#         the entire page content. 
# dynamic: meaning the athe web page has dynamic content that is loaded via js or ajax once the web page has
#          been downloaded or is scrolled. Example of such dynamic pages are e.g. youtube pages where comments are only displayed
#          when the user scrolls down. Scraping such dynamic pages is also supported by WebScraper. Dynamic pages load slower though.
# 
# If renderPages has a value of False, this means that pages are downloaded using http requests and no page rendering is carried out.
# If renderPages has a value of True, this means the pages are downloaded using a page rendering engine used by browsers. 
# 
# Since we access wikipedia articles with no dynamic content, we will statically load these pages. Hence renderPages is set to False. This
# will make page loading faster. If renderPages is missing, it defaults to False.

#  List of rules that will be applied to every downloaded page starts here.
#
#  Rules are grouped into a library. All rules will be applied to the 
#  downloaded page if some rule-specific conditions are met. If rule-specific
#  conditions are not met, the rule is not applied. 
#  Each rule extracts specific data or list of data from the (same) page.

# List of individual rules comprising this library and that will be applied to each page downloaded follows. 
# This library consists of one rule only, named articleTitle. The value extracted by this rule
# will be assigned to a special key/variable with the same name as the rule i.e. articleTitle.
# These keys/variables can be references inside thi rule file e.g. see csvLineFormat field above.
