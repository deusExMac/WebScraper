# Example library 7.1: Demonstrating the use of post match preconditions in rule getLinks to extract and follow links that meet more complicated
#                      conditions.
#                      
# 
# Related fields: ruleMatchPreconditions, getLinks, ecCSSSelector, ecTextCondition, ecRuleCSSSelector, ruleCSSSelector  
#
# TODO: Update/fix content below this line
#
# When to use match preconditions:
#      1) When you want to apply more checks to all the elements returned by ruleCSSSelector although this can also be
#         effected by carefullt authoring CSS selector for ruleCSSSelector.
#      2) When you want to extract subdata from each element based on value of the extracted data by ruleCSSSelector. You may for example
#         achieve behaviors like: for each result, get the value of the 3rd td only if the the 5th td matches a specific regular expression.
#
# The example rule below extracts the name of football teams that have won the Champions league more than three times (>3) in their club history.
# It does this by downloading the wikipedia page 
#
#    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_Cup_and_UEFA_Champions_League_finals
#
# and extracting data from the table with caption "Performances in the European Cup and UEFA Champions League by club".
#
# To achieve this, the rule does the following once the above wikipedia page has been downloaded:
#
# 1) Extracts all table rows of a specific table (tr) containing club names and the times they have won the Champions League
# 2) Applies a match precondition on EACH tr element extracted in 1) that checks i) if a specific td, containing data on the number of times a 
#    team has won, has value greater than 3 and ii) if i) holds, it returns the name of the team which is in a different part (a th) of the same table row (tr) by applying
#    ecRuleCSSSelector on the tr element currently processed. 
#
# More than one match preconditions can be defined in the context of the same rule. Currently, only operator ANY is supported for these match preconditions.
# If multiple match preconditions match, the first matching precondition's ecRuleCSSSelector is applied, if specified.
# 
# How to use this rule:
#
# crawl -n 1 -r rules/example7.1-en.wikipedia.exr -o csv/example7.1.csv  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_Cup_and_UEFA_Champions_League_finals

# IMPORTANT: date the url was accessed (dateaccessed) and the url are always automatically added to the csv file

# How should the downloaded html page be rendered.
# WebScraper supports two modes of URL downloads:
# static: meaning that the web page does not load its content dynamically (via js or ajax) and one http request is enough to get
#         the entire page content. 
# dynamic: meaning the athe web page has dynamic content that is loaded via js or ajax once the web page has
#          been downloaded or is scrolled. Example of such dynamic pages are e.g. youtube pages where comments are only displayed
#          when the user scrolls down. Scraping such dynamic pages is also supported by WebScraper. Dynamic pages load slower though.
# 
# If renderPages has a value of False, this means the no page rendering is carried out and should be used only in case of pages that
# do not load content dynamicaly.
# If renderPages has a value of True, this means the page rendering is done and should be used only in case of pages that load content
# dynamically. 
# 
# Since we access wikipedia articles with no dynamic content, we will statically load these pages. Hence renderPages is set to False. This
# will make page loading faster. If renderPages is missing, it defaults to False.

"renderPages":False,



# List of individual rules comprising this library and that will be applied to each page downloaded follows. 
# This library consists of one rule only, named articleTitle. The value extracted by this rule

# These keys/variables can be references inside the rule file e.g. see csvLineFormat field above.
