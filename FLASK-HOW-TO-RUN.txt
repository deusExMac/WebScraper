I) Before you start FLASK app:
  1) Istall python modules (see README-IMPORTANT.txt for details)
  2) Place/install monaco editor source in proper directory. 
     Update ALL paths for monaco editor in exrEditor.html. Currently, paths 
     have a /static/ in front of them. Change them appropriatelly.
  3) Folder mthemes in /static/ contains third-party/additional monaco skins. 
     This folder is used by the app to set the editor skin. Place it in the 
     appropriate folder and change relative paths in file exrEditor.html .

II) How to run FLASK app (main file: app.py) USING THE BUILD-IN DEVELOPEMENT WEB SERVER:

* change directory into your flask application folder.

* On Windows: C:\...>env\Scripts\activate

* On MacOS: $>. env/bin/activate

After activating environment,  run main flask app .py file with 2 ways:

# if environment variable set
(env)$>flask run

# if webApp.py is the main app file to be executed
(env)$>flask --app webApp.py run

Now your app is ready to recieve requests.

NOTE: This is only for debugging purposes. flask apps can also be executed in the context of Wamp or any
other Web server.
