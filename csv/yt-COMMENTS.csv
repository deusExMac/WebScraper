Unfortunately, since Predator 2 wasn\'t a success financially, 20th Century Fox cancelled these sequels, so Dark Horse turned the story into a comic instead called \'Predator 1718\'. This comic story explains that the pistol belonged to an 18th century pirate captain called Raphael Adolini, where he faced mutiny by his crew who attacked him. Outnumbered, he fought bravely, but was no match. However, from the distance, a young Predator had arrived on Earth and quietly watched the fight, intending to kill everyone and take Adolini\'s skull as a trophy. But it was intrigued by the battle, and impressed by Adolini\'s courage to keep fighting depsite the odds. Seeing Adolini was worthy, the Predator decided not to kill him as a trophy but instead respect him, and joined in and fought back to back with Adolini, defeating his entire crew together. Seemingly victorious, Adolini cheered as he had won.....but one of his crew suddenly shoots him in the back, before dying. Critically injured and with his last dying breath, Adolini gives his pistol to the young Predator as a sign of respect, and simply says ""take it..."" before dying. Many years later that same Predator, now an elder high ranked greyback, is seen here - once again impressed at the bravery of another warrior in the face of being outnumbered despite the odds and having the courage to still fight, and passes on the gun to Harrigan as a sign of respect, honour and courage, exactly as Adolini once did to him, mimicking what was said to him. I really reccomend the comics for some really awesome lore and extended universe material, and stories which were supposed to be movies we sadly never got! Edit: wow! Thanks so much for the likes and responses! I\'ve just come back to say that I\'m happy we\'re getting a new movie called PREY, about Native Americans fighting Predators. Although this was already done in the comics (Predator:Big Game was about a Natvie American Navajo corporal fighting a Pred and a prequel story was about his ancestors fighting them) this new movie is an entirely new story based on the idea. I hope it does well and we get more Predator movies based off the comics. Thank you and hope you all enjoy the movie!\nShow less\nRead more\n10K\n10K\nReply', 'For those wondering: the pistol was given to set up a potential sequel to show that the Predators had been coming to earth for centuries, and the original planned Predator 3 movie would have been set in the past to show how the pistol was earned, and show how other people through the ages had fought the Predators with more primitive weaponry (there were further sequels planned to be based during World War 1, the Civil War, Crimean war, Crusades, even Predators fighting Indigenous peoples, Mayans, Vikings, Aztecs, Knights, Zulu warriors etc).
