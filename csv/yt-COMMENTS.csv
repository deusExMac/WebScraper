Then, it doesn\'t matter whether you have the ""features"" as columns or rows – Corr(feat) = feature-wise correlation matrix, where entries represent the correlation between two features, and the eigenvectors of this matrix are the ""eigenfeatures"". If you happen to have ""features"" as columns, then Corr(feat) = [X][X^T]. If you happen to have the ""features"" as rows, then Corr(feat) = [X^T][X]. Similarly, for the ""snapshots"" we have the Corr(snap) = snapshot-wise correlation matrix, where entries represent the correlation between two snapshots, and the eigenvectors of this matrix are the ""eigensnapshots"". Again, depending on whether the ""snapshots"" are in the rows or columns of X, you can find Corr(snap). This also helps when doing PCA, as you generally wish to reduce the number of ""features"", and are therefore interested in determining the eigenvectors of Corr(feat). No need to sweat over how your data is organized in the matrix X, or any annoying conventions for PCA. In short, it is easier to think of ""features & snapshots"" than ""rows & columns"".\nShow less\nRead more\n0\n0\nReply', 'It can be helpful to use the names ""features"" (to refer to the \'n\' different pixels in a photo, or the \'n\' different characteristics of rats which may predict cancer) and ""snapshots"" (to refer to the \'m\' different measurements (e.g. people\'s photos, or rats)).
