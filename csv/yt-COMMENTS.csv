Nice shout out to 3blue1brown — watching this reminded me of his videos and style (though his visualizations are insane :] ). One question: from the end of your video, it seems to me that eigenvalues can be thought of as measures of feature importance, but in your housing example, multiple similar features (size, #rooms, etc) become a new single representative feature. How do we know what the features are that we are left with after PCA in much higher dimensional examples? Say we reduce a 100 dimensional data set to 10 dimensions, how do we know what those 10 dimensions represent?
