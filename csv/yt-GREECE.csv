There\'s a deep humanity in Greek culture that makes human interactions at the same time feel honest and intense. I\'ve been living in Greece for 18 years and have come to understand why my Greek mother in law would speak of tourists with such compassion. She says ""they are far from home, they don\'t know the place, they are like little children and we have to protect them."" In the beginning I found her approach to tourists a bit weird, but after living here so long I understand why she feels that way, but I can\'t put it into words. I find Greeks have a sense of dignity that isn\'t linked to status or appearance, but to knowing who they are and being raised within a culture that values human relationships, music, arts, food and spirituality as daily basic needs. You can argue with a Greek and really get upset with each other and then a bit later if they see you need help they\'ll just help you. Because before being that guy you had a fight with, you\'re a human being.\nShow less\nRead more\n181\n181\nReply', 'In Greece a human is always a human.

Also issues of pollution can be seen on the island as tourism creates massive piles of garbage. I was surprised that islands such as Rhodes or Kefalonia were not on the list.

He was one of the very few non-aristocrats in Athens to gain military and political leadership. He got the Athenians to build their naval fleet. He got the Persians to think that the Greek fleet was disunited and ripe for defeat. He have them sail in a narrow area negating their superior numbers of ships. He defeated them decisively which forced the Persians to send their majority of soldiers back to Persia. He set up their eventual defeat on land which ended their threat against Greece. He organized the rebuilding of Athens including a superior defense system against Sparta which greatly angered them. He gave Athens a navy which greatly increased the size and wealth of the Athenian Empire. He was exiled by the Athenians with connivance from Sparta. He ended up as Governor of a district in the Persian Empire. Pretty good for a Greek who prevented the Persian conquest of his country.

He was one of the very few non-aristocrats in Athens to gain military and political leadership. He got the Athenians to build their naval fleet. He got the Persians to think that the Greek fleet was disunited and ripe for defeat. He have them sail in a narrow area negating their superior numbers of ships. He defeated them decisively which forced the Persians to send their majority of soldiers back to Persia. He set up their eventual defeat on land which ended their threat against Greece. He organized the rebuilding of Athens including a superior defense system against Sparta which greatly angered them.

He was one of the very few non-aristocrats in Athens to gain military and political leadership. He got the Athenians to build their naval fleet. He got the Persians to think that the Greek fleet was disunited and ripe for defeat. He have them sail in a narrow area negating their superior numbers of ships. He defeated them decisively which forced the Persians to send their majority of soldiers back to Persia. He set up their eventual defeat on land which ended their threat against Greece. He organized the rebuilding of Athens including a superior defense system against Sparta which greatly angered them. He gave Athens a navy which greatly increased the size and wealth of the Athenian Empire. He was exiled by the Athenians with connivance from Sparta. He ended up as Governor of a district in the Persian Empire. Pretty good for a Greek who prevented the Persian conquest of his country.

Then 1 island away just within view you are at Gyalos the Pumice island ajd one of the biggest pumice sources in the world. Completely different in looks. Then 1 island further you are at Nisyros island which is a volcano island which again is a completely different island completely different scenery yet again. And the next island will be completely different again. Just like Milos the geological paradise where you find EVERY color of mountains, rocks, stones, even rainbow mountain layers which is extremely rare in this world. And then Santorini which is the largest sea volcano in the world. With its strong red colors, black, but also 70 meter high outrageous cliff geological beauties like Vlychada beach. And like that. Every island but also every place in Greeces mainland is in-cre-dible and unique. Greece is a collection of paradises. And yes. This video was about Salamis. Greece has too many beautifuo topics to talk about.

He was one of the very few non-aristocrats in Athens to gain military and political leadership. He got the Athenians to build their naval fleet. He got the Persians to think that the Greek fleet was disunited and ripe for defeat. He have them sail in a narrow area negating their superior numbers of ships. He defeated them decisively which forced the Persians to send their majority of soldiers back to Persia. He set up their eventual defeat on land which ended their threat against Greece. He organized the rebuilding of Athens including a superior defense system against Sparta which greatly angered them. He gave Athens a navy which greatly increased the size and wealth of the Athenian Empire. He was exiled by the Athenians with connivance from Sparta. He ended up as Governor of a district in the Persian Empire. Pretty good for a Greek who prevented the Persian conquest of his country.
